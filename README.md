# task1elevatelabs
For the task 1,I have chosen a raw dataset of chocolate sales.
Dataset Cleanup Summary-This dataset contains product-wise sales records of a chocolate business, including Product_ID, Product_Name, Category, Units_Sold, Price_per_Unit, and Total_Revenue.
Changes I Made During Data Cleaning:
1.Standardized text formatting for Product_Name and Category (e.g., "milk choco" → "Milk Choco").
2.Corrected inconsistent casing across all categorical fields.
3.Fixed duplicate Product_IDs, ensuring each product has a unique identifier.
4.Verified and recalculated Total_Revenue using Units_Sold × Price_per_Unit to ensure accuracy.
5.Removed redundant or conflicting entries caused by inconsistent data input.
